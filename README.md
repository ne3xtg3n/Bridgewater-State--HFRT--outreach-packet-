0) Plain‑Language Overview — What is SCM?

SCM says the universe (or any closed computational world we simulate) is a manifold of information that updates itself by two intertwined rules:

1. Quantum‑consistent evolution (nothing illegal like probabilities > 1).


2. Self‑optimization of local simplicity (it prefers cleaner, purer local states), while allowing global structure to emerge.



You can picture the world as nodes (subsystems) connected by links (correlations). The strength of each link is given by mutual information (how much two parts know about each other). As the manifold updates, it steers itself to make local neighborhoods purer (less mixed) while letting patterns of correlation rearrange. Those patterns define an information geometry. Curvature in this geometry (derived from the correlation network) plays the role of emergent “space‑time bending.”

In short: SCM is a quantum‑law‑abiding system that optimizes local purity and lets geometry emerge from correlations. It is self‑simulating because the manifold’s state determines both the next state and the rules of re‑connection between parts.

1) Notation and Preliminaries

Global Hilbert space: , with qubits  by default.

Global state: pure  or mixed .

Neighborhoods:  (e.g., ring neighbors).

Reduced state on subsystem : .

Purity: .

2‑Rényi entropy: .

Quantum mutual information (QMI):  (with  the von Neumann entropy).

Adjoint of partial trace: For operator  on , .



---

2) Axioms of SCM

A1 — Substrate (Informational Manifold).
A collection of quantum subsystems  arranged on a dynamic graph . Edges carry weights from correlation measures (default: QMI).

A2 — Dual Update Rule (Physics + Optimization).
Time‑continuous evolution combines a Hamiltonian part with a projected variational part:

\boxed{\ \ \n\dot \rho = -i[H,\rho]\;\;{-}\;\kappa\,\Pi_\rho\big(\nabla_\rho \mathcal J(\rho)\big),\quad \kappa>0\ }

A3 — Emergent Locality.
Locality is not assumed; it emerges because the cost  is a sum over neighborhoods and because topology rewiring penalizes long‑range complexity.

A4 — Invariance → Conservation.
Noether‑style: symmetries of  and of  yield conserved currents (e.g., phase symmetry → charge; time symmetry → energy expectations).

A5 — Stability as Fixed Points.
Long‑lived structures are fixed points (or slow manifolds) of the combined flow; they behave as error‑corrected loops under the CPTP refresh.

3) Variational Objective and Gradients

3.1 Cost Functional (Local 2‑Rényi Program)

We optimize for local purity on chosen neighborhoods :

\boxed{\ \ \n\mathcal J(\rho)
= \sum_{S\in\mathcal N} \big(1 - \mathrm{Tr}(\rho_S^2)\big)
= |\mathcal N| - \sum_{S\in\mathcal N} \Pi(\rho_S).\ }

3.2 Functional Derivative wrt Global Density Matrix

Use  and adjoint of partial trace:

\delta \mathcal J = -\sum_{S} 2\,\mathrm{Tr}\big(\rho_S\,\delta \rho_S\big)
= -2\sum_S \mathrm{Tr}\Big(\rho_S\,\mathrm{Tr}_{S^c}(\delta\rho)\Big)
= -2\sum_S \mathrm{Tr}\Big(\big(\rho_S\otimes I_{S^c}\big)\,\delta\rho\Big).

\boxed{\ \ \n\nabla_\rho \mathcal J(\rho) = -2\sum_{S\in\mathcal N} \big(\rho_S \otimes I_{S^c}\big).\ }

3.3 Projected Gradient Flow (Mixed States)

To preserve quantum constraints we advance by a CPTP proximal step (Sec. 4.3). The formal projected flow writes

\dot \rho = -i[H,\rho] - \kappa\,\Pi_\rho\!\left( -2\sum_S \rho_S\otimes I_{S^c} \right).

3.4 State‑Vector Form (Pure States)

For , using :

\delta \mathcal J = -2\sum_S \langle\psi|\big(\rho_S\otimes I\big)|\delta\psi\rangle + \text{c.c.}
\Rightarrow \nabla_{|\psi\rangle}\mathcal J = -2\sum_S \big(\rho_S\otimes I\big)|\psi\rangle.

\boxed{\ \ \n\dot{|\psi\rangle} = -iH|\psi\rangle - \kappa\big(I - |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\big)\,\Big[\,2\sum_S (\rho_S\otimes I)\,\Big]|\psi\rangle.\ }

4) The SCM Update Pipeline

4.1 Continuous‑Time Idealization

1. Unitary microstep: .


2. Variational microstep: gradient descent on  with projection to valid states.



4.2 Discrete Trotterization (Implemented)

For each step k:

1. Unitary: , with .


2. Gradient push: , with .


3. Projection (PSD + trace‑1):
   • Hermitize: .
   • Diagonalize: .
   • Threshold  at 0, renormalize .
   • Recompose: .


4. Optional CPTP refresh: apply weak depolarizing/phase‑damping channel to mimic stabilizing error‑correction while staying within physical maps.



4.3 CPTP Implementation Note

Any non‑unitary step must be realized by a completely positive, trace‑preserving map (e.g., Kraus form , ).

Our “projection” is realized by PSD eigenvalue clipping + renormalization, which is equivalent to a closest‑PSD operation; optionally, one replaces it with a Lindblad step whose steady state is the projected point for a principled CPTP flow.

5) Correlation Network and Information Geometry

5.1 MI‑Weighted Graph

Nodes: subsystems .

Edge weight: , default .


5.2 Curvature Proxies

(a) Inverse‑MI toy curvature)
 with small .

(b) Ollivier–Ricci curvature on graphs)
For neighbors’ probability spreads  and graph distance :

(: earth‑mover distance w.r.t. edge lengths ). Positive  indicates contraction (sphere‑like), negative indicates expansion (hyperbolic‑like).

(c) Forman–Ricci (computationally cheaper) is also supported and tracks local weighted degree structure.


---

6) Simulation Results (n=5 and n=8)

Setup: ring neighborhoods; objective  above; projected 2‑Rényi gradient; small stabilizing CPTP refresh; steps of size  after unitary microstep.

6.1 n=5 (summary)

Cost monotonically decreases and stabilizes.

Mean pair purity increases and plateaus.

MI rises from uniform low values to a stable, moderately correlated pattern.

Toy curvature (1/(ε+I)) correspondingly dips where MI strengthens.


6.2 n=8 (detailed behavior)

Cost: ~5.999 → ~4.74 over 14 steps (strong descent, then tapering).

Mean pair purity: 0.254 → 0.407 (peak ~step 11), then near‑flat.

MI: tiny at start (), rises mid‑run (peaks ~0.03 on selected pairs), then collapses to  at step 14.

Toy curvature: large at start, drops mid‑run, then blows up at final step consistent with near‑zero MI.


Interpretation: With this cost and topology, maximizing local purity tends to a globally decorrelated fixed point for n=8 under the tested schedule. That is a phase‑like transition versus n=5 (which retained moderate MI). It suggests a trade‑off: purity target vs. persistent long‑range structure. Curvature responds inversely to MI as designed.

6A) Equations & Interactions — Detailed Explanations

This section translates each governing equation into what it does and how it couples to the rest of SCM.

(E1) Unitary microstep:  ρ → U ρ U†, with U = exp(−i H Δt).

Meaning: conservative physics; preserves spectrum of ρ, von Neumann entropy, all purities.

Interaction: sets the “direction” allowed by Hamiltonian dynamics; the optimizer then nudges along CPTP-safe descent directions.


(E2) Purity cost:  J = Σ_{S∈N} [1 − Tr(ρ_S²)].

Meaning: lower J means higher neighborhood purities.

Interaction: competes with global entanglement budgets (monogamy); affects pairwise MI.


(E3) Gradient:  ∇ρ J = −2 Σ_S (ρ_S ⊗ I{S^c}).

Meaning: pushes weight onto dominant local eigenvectors of each ρ_S.

Interaction: tends to align ρ with edge-local product structures when unopposed.


(E4) Projected step:  ρ ← Π_{PSD, tr=1}( ρ − η ∇J ).

Meaning: stays on the manifold of valid density operators (PSD + unit trace).

Interaction: equivalent to a proximal map; can be realized by a brief Lindblad evolution (CPTP by construction).


(E5) MI-weighted geometry:  w_ij = I(i:j),  ℓ_ij = 1 / max(ε, I(i:j)).

Meaning: correlations define short edges and thick pipes of information flow.

Interaction: feeds curvature estimators and the rewiring energy C(G,ρ).


(E6) Curvature (Ollivier–Ricci):  κ(i,j) = 1 − W₁(m_i, m_j) / d(i,j), with m_i(j) = w_ij / Σ_k w_ik and d(i,j) = 1 / w_ij.

Meaning: measures transport contraction between neighbor distributions; κ>0 indicates clustered, redundant information.

Interaction: positive κ stabilizes clusters; negative κ flags brittle bridges.


(E7) Multi-objective SCM:  ṼJ = α J_purity − β Σ I(i:j) + γ Σ penalty(ℓ_ij), α,β,γ>0.

Meaning: introduces competition — keep neighborhoods pure and links informative.

Interaction: generates phase structure and nontrivial geometry at larger n.


(E8) Fixed points:  −i[H,ρ*] = κ Π_{ρ*}( 2 Σ_S ρ_S ⊗ I_{S^c} ).

Meaning: balance of conservative and proximal flows.

Interaction: characterizes attractors (“where the optimizer lives”).

6B) n=8 Scaling Analysis — Results and Rationale

Config: n=8 qubits, 14 steps, grad_step η=0.06, seed=11, ring neighbors.

Key traces

Cost C = Σ_{(i,j)} [1 − Tr(ρ_ij²)] : 5.999 → … → 4.74 (t=14).

Mean pair purity: 0.254 → 0.407 (peak ~t=11–12), ~0.406 at t=14.

MI snapshots: t=0 ≈ 1e−5–1e−4; t=7 bands up to ≈3e−2; t=14 ≈ 1e−9–1e−15.

Curvature proxy K=1/(ε+I): large at t=0, dips where MI rises at t=7, huge again at t=14.


Why purity can kill pairwise MI Maximizing Σ (Tr ρ_ij²) increases local purity. For global pure states this is compatible with reducing pairwise MI, especially on sparse graphs: the optimizer can satisfy purity by shedding correlations, landing at near-product pairs with MI≈0. Linearizing the CPTP-projected map around the observed fixed point shows fast decay of off-edge coherences, matching the MI collapse.

How to preserve structure Adopt the multi-objective ṼJ (above) with β>0. This biases against decorrelation and yields clustered phases. Upgrade curvature to Ollivier–Ricci or Forman–Ricci for geometry that remains informative even when raw MI is small.

Next runs

1. Longer schedules + backtracking line search (test for late-time MI revival vs true convergence).


2. Sweeps over (α,β,γ) to map the decorrelated ↔ clustered phase diagram.


3. Curvature swap to ORC/FRC; export κ maps + histograms.


4. n=9 using sparse/Krylov exponentials and randomized-SVD PSD projection.


5. Diagnostics: eigenvalue floors, trace errors, Kraus positivity, MI sum-rules.

7) Predictions and Discriminating Tests

1. High‑k dispersion kink (discreteness):
. Look for energy‑dependent delays in high‑energy photons/neutrinos.


2. Complexity‑scaled interferometer noise:
Cross‑spectral features that scale with Kolmogorov complexity of the entangling drive rather than with thermal baselines.


3. Vacuum spectrum tilt under modulation:
Casimir‑like experiments showing program‑dependent deviations under entropy modulation.


4. Entropy thresholds in arrays:
Abrupt ordering as neighborhood S2 hits predicted minima (dot arrays or Rydberg lattices).


5. GW echoes:
Subleading echo structure consistent with recursive error‑correction (timing patterns distinct from standard templates).




---

8) Failure Modes (How SCM Could Be Wrong)

No high‑k dispersion within strong bounds → discreteness scale pushed beyond relevance or absent.

No complexity‑scaled noise in interferometers → optimization noise claim weakened.

No entropy thresholds in controllable arrays → recursion pressure overstated.

MI never persists at scale for any Hamiltonian/topology → cost needs multi‑term trade (Sec. 9.2).



---

9) Design Choices, Extensions, and “What You’d Do Next”

9.1 Why 2‑Rényi?

Algebraic simplicity: derivative is linear in .

Physical meaning: purity directly tracks mixedness/coherence.

Computational tractability for moderate n.


9.2 Multi‑Objective Variant (to preserve structure)

Add MI‑retention and graph sparsity terms:

\tilde{\mathcal J} = \alpha\,\mathcal J_{\text{purity}} \ -\ \beta\,\sum_{(i,j)\in E} I(i{:}j) \ +\ \gamma\,\sum_{(i,j)\in E} \mathrm{penalty}(\ell_{ij}),\quad \alpha,\beta,\gamma\!>\!0.

9.3 Topology Rewiring Rule

Define a graph energy

\mathcal C(G,\rho) = \sum_{(i,j)} c\big(I(i{:}j)\big) + \lambda\,\mathrm{Var}(\deg(i)),\quad c'\!\le 0

9.4 Geometry Upgrade

Switch curvature to Ollivier–Ricci on the MI‑weighted graph; report  histograms and spatial maps. Use Forman–Ricci as a performant proxy.

11) Worked Derivations (Details)

11.1 Gradient wrt ρ for 

As above: . Therefore any representative gradient in the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product is . For numerical stability, we symmetrize and ensure Hermiticity: the expression is already Hermitian when  is.

11.2 Projection Operator 

We need steps that remain in the manifold of density matrices (PSD, trace 1). In practice: PSD‑projection via eigenvalue clipping is the orthogonal projection in Frobenius norm onto the cone; renormalization enforces trace. A principled alternative is a Lindblad generator  whose short‑time map approximates this projection and is automatically CPTP.

11.3 Pure‑State Projected Gradient

On the complex unit sphere (or complex projective space), the Euclidean gradient is orthogonally projected by  to preserve . This yields the state‑vector equation in Sec. 3.4.

11.4 Mutual Information and Curvature Mapping

We choose edge lengths . For ORC, neighbor measures are . Compute . Interpretation: positive  → volumes contract (correlated clusters); negative  → volumes expand (fragile links).

One manifold, one rule. The physics is the consequence of the update, not the premise.

Let geometry emerge. Correlation patterns write the metric; you don’t assume spacetime, you infer it.

5. Purity (\gamma)
Definition:
Purity measures how “pure” or “uncorrelated” a quantum state is.
Formula:
P(\rho) = \mathrm{Tr}(\rho^2)
Range:
 * 1 \rightarrow pure state (maximally ordered)
 * 1/d \rightarrow maximally mixed state in d-dimensional space
Explanation:
In SCM, we optimize for local purity in each neighborhood, which tends to increase order in the manifold’s structure.
6. 2-Rényi Entropy (S_2)
Definition:
A special case of Rényi entropy that is directly related to purity:
S_2(\rho) = -\log_2 \mathrm{Tr}(\rho^2)
Explanation:
Lower S_2 means higher purity. In SCM, minimizing S_2 in neighborhoods is equivalent to maximizing purity.
7. Projected 2-Rényi Gradient Optimizer
Definition:
A variational optimization algorithm that updates the system state to minimize the sum of local 2-Rényi entropies (maximize local purity).
Cost Function:
C = \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \left( 1 - \mathrm{Tr}(\rho_{ij}^2) \right)
Explanation:
The optimizer “pushes” the system toward configurations with high local order.
8. Quantum Mutual Information (QMI, I)
Definition:
A measure of total correlation (quantum + classical) between two subsystems A and B.
Formula:
I(A:B) = S(\rho_A) + S(\rho_B) - S(\rho_{AB})
where S(\rho) = -\mathrm{Tr}(\rho \log_2 \rho) is von Neumann entropy.
Explanation:
In SCM, QMI values act as “edge weights” between nodes in the informational manifold.
9. Curvature Proxy
Definition:
A simplified measure of “informational curvature” derived from mutual information:
K = \frac{1}{\epsilon + I}
Explanation:
 * High MI \rightarrow low curvature (strong connection)
 * Low MI \rightarrow high curvature (weak connection)
   This models how correlations “bend” the informational geometry.
10. Ollivier–Ricci Curvature (Graph Version)
Definition:
A more sophisticated curvature measure defined on weighted graphs, used to capture local geometric structure from network topology.
Explanation:
Replacing the simple K = 1/(\epsilon + I) with Ollivier–Ricci curvature provides a richer, more physically meaningful picture of the emergent geometry in SCM.
11. Informational Geometry
Definition:
A representation of geometry where distances and curvature are defined by information-theoretic quantities (like QMI) rather than physical space.
Explanation:
In SCM, informational geometry emerges from the evolving correlations between qubits, allowing spacetime-like structures to be simulated from purely informational rules.
12. Self-Simulation Principle
Definition:
The principle that each subsystem’s state evolution encodes part of the global manifold’s structure, allowing the manifold to “contain” its own simulation.
Explanation:
This is the conceptual bridge between SCM and models of emergent spacetime—local updates give rise to a global geometry that is consistent with those same local rules.
